📌 Project Idea Base (PIB)

A minimal MERN application built to store, organize, and preserve project ideas in one place.
I often get random ideas for projects or features, but I forget them later — so I built PIB as a simple personal tool to keep everything structured.

🚀 Purpose

A private space to store project ideas and future features.

A better alternative (for me) compared to tools like Notion.

A hands-on practice project to strengthen my MERN stack skills.

📝 Add, view, and manage project ideas
